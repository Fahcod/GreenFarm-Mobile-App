## Welcome to GreenFarm Mobile App

GreenFarm is a platform that provides farmers with farming tips through videos in
local languages and through articles. It is free to farmers, and it has been made free for them
in order to make it easy for all farmers to access without needing to first pay.

Therefore, farmers can create free accounts and use the app to learn new skills or improve on
those that they have. However, the near future the paid `PRO` plan will be introduced and it will come along with greater features and farmers will have to first pay something in order to access these features

# GreenFarm Marketplace

Greenfarm is also an online marketplace for Agri-businesses that need to advertise and sell their
products to a larger audience. Therefore, these businesses can create stores in the app and add products which can be seen by all farmers on the platform and these farmers can then buy the products basing on their need. However, these stores are paid for monthly and for now, there is only one plan but in the future, as the platform  grows, more plans will come in and they will vary depending on the features and the functionality

## How to run the Frontend:

# Step 1:
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine, then clone the

# Step 2:
Open your terminal and run `npm install`, to install the project dependencies

# Step 3:
After the dependencies have been installed, run `npx expo start` in order to start the app and
you will be provided with a `QR` code that you can scan and run the app righ there on your device but you must have the `Expo Go` application on your mobile phone. Or else if you have Android Studio, you can just type `a` in your terminal in order to open your app in an emulator
